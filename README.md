# Enhancements

Desktop notifications shown in the notification center can trigger a javascript callback when clicked, so that you can deeplink into the part of your application that triggered the notification.

Added a javascript call to determine if the current window is the frontmost ("active") application on the Mac.

Usage examples for these are in index.html
